# Write a Python program that takes a string as input and counts the frequency of each word in the string. The program should store the word frequencies in a dictionary and display the result.
# Here are the steps to follow:
# Prompt the user to enter a sentence or a paragraph.
# Remove any punctuation marks from the input string (e.g., commas, periods, exclamation marks).
# Convert the string to lowercase to make the word frequency case-insensitive.
# Split the string into a list of words using the split() method.
# Create an empty dictionary to store the word frequencies.
# Iterate over the list of words and update the dictionary with the frequency of each word. If a word is already in the dictionary, increment its count by 1. If itâ€™s not in the dictionary, add it as a new key with a value of 1.
# Display the word frequencies in alphabetical order, along with their corresponding counts.




import string

# Create a phone book program that allows users to store and retrieve contact information. The program should use dictionaries and lists to store the data.
# Implement a menu-based system that provides the following options:
# Add a new contact: Prompt the user to enter a name and phone number, and add them to the phone book dictionary as a key-value pair.
# Search for a contact: Prompt the user to enter a name, and display the corresponding phone number from the phone book dictionary.
# List all contacts: Display all the contacts in the phone book, showing both the names and phone numbers.
# Exit the program: Terminate the program.
# Continuously prompt the user for their choice until they choose to exit the program.
